## v0.2

- Beta release: added the retro-inspired UI, key/country storage, Exa integration, keyboard hotkeys, theme selector, and updated documentation.
- Added Serper Search as a secondary provider (requires its own key)

## v0.3

- Added locally persisted custom CSS overrides with inline apply/remove controls to restyle the interface via any CORS-friendly stylesheet.
